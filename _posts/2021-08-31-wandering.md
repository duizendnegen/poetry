I carry a compass and a magnet wherever I go<br>
in case I'm lost or don't like where I'm headed next<br>
extra boots and matches in case my feet get tired of wandering

and I do get tired, sometimes<br>
when I'm left stranded in a port town riddled with identical red-bricked buildings<br>
no boy that knows my name

I'm left longing to be nothing more<br>
nothing more than just myself, just for a day<br>
doing justice to all this trying<br>
only being this fast, this smart<br>
only this tall

so far in life I've been gifted flowers<br>
a parakeet to sing until I fall asleep<br>
a wooden watch<br>
and honestly I feel like I'm behind on catching on how loving all of it has been<br>
as if I'm not grateful really, or undeserving<br>
I've been wanting to give so much more than warm gestures of some sort<br>
but I seem to only bring back home new socks from all these ports

and although pampered with soft cushions and fancy magazines<br>
I am comforted most when I perform the ritual most known to me<br>
checking whether my front door is locked <br>
longing for safety<br>
for the third time now<br>
before I drift off into the night
